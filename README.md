# üèôÔ∏è Tiny Tower Elevator Automation
A Python-based automation built to help service Bitizens who request elevator rides and automatically delivers them to the correct floor ‚Äî fully hands-free.

Used to farm coins in the mobile game [Tiny Tower by NimbleBit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Tower), running on an iPhone emulator.

Involves real-time computer vision, OCR, and GUI automation working together to interpret and act on live game state from the screen.
